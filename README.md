This program allows you to paint a dynamic landscape by presenting you with different options. 
The program takes you through a series of screens, each time prompting you to select a different feature of the painting. 
You can click on the options with the mouse to see what they look like, then when you decide on one press the right key to move onto the next screen.
At the end of the program your choices will be combined into a moving landscape.

When you run the program, the first two screens are an introduction and directions. 
You can press the right key to move through them. 
The next screen gives you the choice of three times of day: dawn, noon, and dusk.
Your selection will determine the color of the background.
The next screen gives you the options of painting grass, hills, or sea in the foreground.
After this, a screen prompts you to select a weather type: sunny, snowy, or cloudy.
Once you press the right arrow after selecting the weather, the final painting will be displayed.

This program uses openGL and GLUT, and borrows code from the Runner and Confettify guided projects.
